# COP4331 Project: Mortal Pongbat

## Vision Statement
Mortal Pongbat will be a unique twist to the classic Pong game by incorporating elements of a fighting game. While previous variations of Pong may change the playing field or the amount of players, our game will allow players to select from a variety of characters each with a unique speed, power, and way to hit the ball, that encourages a new way to master the game. For those who want to compete with their friends one on one, the goal is that it will provide a familiar entry point to fighting games that anyone can enjoy.
